#This project will hopefully be the little spin of evolutionary story from the
#ATAC seq project


meeting 17th June
taylor et al used DAF to to argue that what they were seeing was difference in mutational rate.

Derived allele tests when we did them were consistent with insight.


David expects mutation rate might be higher in things like germ line accessible sites.

David doesn’t expect eA to be very interesting. Rarely positive not very robust statistic.

To get a sane alpha in drosophila you have to subsample sites over and over with INSIGHT and take average. (not robust)
Rho is probably better - probably good measure of fitness consequences of new mutation.
We want to look at E.W. Rho and alpha

We can also do Phastcons and PhyloP


Pleotitropy results
how can we eliminate higher mutational frequency?
Experimental stuff so far didn’t support.
DAF test.

INSIGHT was run by pointing do_insight_runs.sh on a folder full of beds. 

INSIGHT runs may actually be for distal sights only.
build peak sets seems to remove proximal sites

Pi - polymorphism period - we can maybe see if there’s just a higher pi in our less pleiotropic sites.
So we could try and use this to see if we’re having different mutation rates in our test vs blocks, or in our more pleiotropic sites.


Tsne and clustering.
Monocle is a software package the makes temporal series. 
Also working on spatial sorting. Seems super cool.
